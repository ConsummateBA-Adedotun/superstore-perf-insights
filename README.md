This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore dataset using Excel PivotTables and Pivot Charts to uncover actionable insights into business performance.

The dataset was imported from Kaggle, a trusted open-source platform for real-world data, ensuring relevance and depth for business analysis.

Key findings from the analysis include:

The Technology category consistently led in sales across most regions, particularly in the West, highlighting it as a profitable focus area.

Corporate customers generated the highest profits, indicating strong B2B potential for future campaigns.

While discounts helped drive sales, excessive discounting negatively impacted profitability â€” suggesting a need for smarter pricing strategies.

The monthly profit trend revealed clear seasonality patterns, which can support better planning in marketing and logistics.

By applying Excel functions such as IF, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, and IFERROR, and developing dynamic PivotTables with slicers and visual KPIs, I created an interactive, visually clean Excel dashboard that enables decision-makers to quickly interpret business performance and growth opportunities.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in:

Cleaning and structuring raw data

Applying essential Excel functions for analysis

Designing professional dashboards using Pivot Charts

Communicating insights clearly through data storytelling
